# This is all about presentation project files and review

Going over some stuff that almost everyone got slightly wrong. Not major stuff, so don't feel bad,
but minor stuff we don;t want to keep doing


## Getting Started


### Dependencies

Uses CSS3 and Html5 latest features. Be sure to prefix any bleeding-edge rules, tag, etc hahahahahahahahahahaha
Also using latest ES6/next, you should probably think about including Babel for transpilation.

### Installing

cd to the directory of your choice, clone, and hack away!
